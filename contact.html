                    <p>Wilder Molyneux is a tried and true Seattleite, born on Seattle’s Capitol Hill, educated near and far, and loves the Pacific Northwest. He has a passion for full stack web development. He started programming computers at the age of eight and has never stopped his love for technology, computing, and rapid change.</p><br>

                    <p>In his day job, he works at a Fortune 50 multinational corporation as an Enterprise Architect. He holds a certificate in Enterprise Architecture from Carnegie Mellon University and is a certified practitioner of The Open Group’s Architecture Framework (TOGAF), which he uses daily.</p><br>
                
                    <p>When not keeping up with technology or working, you can find Wilder outdoors either flying through the air on bicycles, taking two-wheeled backcountry trips with his friends, or camping with his family.</p>                                -->
