                <p>How long before you can make the jump to light speed? It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.</p>
    
                <p>What a piece of junk. She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. Hello, sir. Which way? All right, men. Load your weapons! Stop that ship! Blast 'em! Chewie, get us out of here! Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.</p>
